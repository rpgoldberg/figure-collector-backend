  # False positive: cross-spawn is a dev dependency (via jest) not in production runtime
  # Verified with: docker run --rm <image> ls /app/node_modules | grep cross-spawn
  # Production image uses: npm ci --omit=dev (excludes all dev dependencies)
  # Scanner detects this from build metadata, not actual installed packages
